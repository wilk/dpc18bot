It’s not just a simple bot, because we added from day 1 natural language processing smartness to it, so that our user base is extended to the project managers, business analysts, and customer engagement teammates. Johnny started as a devops friend for one of our customers, being extremely helpful in our day-to-day tasks. It later evolved to a tech lead/scrum master role, and even reminds us to do our timesheets. Here are some discussions you might have with Johnny: “What tickets are ready for QA?” “What version of the API is installed in production?” “Are there unused branches for the website?” \"Has test coverage decrease in the last week for the API?\" \"What is the development team on the ETL project?\" \"Add Mary as a developer to the API project\".\n",

    "content": "Software Engineering can be extremely difficult and maddening. But it doesn’t have to be. We will explore leveraging various principles to make Software Engineering fun again. We’ll make a case for “Better Code” fueling “Faster Development”.\nToward building our case, we will explore 5 areas:\n* Bad Code vs Agility – What it means to be “Agile” and the impact of Bad Code on Agility.\n* Better Code: Enablers – Enabling Concepts for Better Code such as TDD, Clean Code and Patterns, with an eye toward adapting them to various programming paradigms such as Functional and OOP. While the rest of the presentation will focus on OOP, this section will contain links to great talks covering similar concepts in Functional Programming.\n* Empowering OOP – If OOP is to be chosen as a paradigm, we’ll explore what it means to play to the strengths of this paradigm.\n* Web Application Architectures: When building Web Applications, we’ll explore various architectures that may hinder or promote a sustainable business fueled by better code. We’ll look at leveraging a framework without coupling our business logic to it, to promote greater testability and extensibility. For example, by leveraging some simple patterns such as the Repository Pattern, we will look at not having to permanently commit ourselves to an RDBMS or a NoSQL solution, that it should be easy to change our minds later as business needs evolve, and even adopting “Polyglot Persistence” whereby parts of an application might leverage an RDBMS while others a NoSQL solution.\n* TDD: Better Fuels Faster – Leveraging preceding topics, we’ll put it all together in describing a workflow leveraging test-driven development for shipping better products ... faster, and having fun doing it.\nThe end of this talk will showcase code examples of a real-world Kata for building the service layer of a “Ride Hailing Application”. It will also link to recorded Kata videos, as well as a “clean slate” branch in my git repository to follow along. If you wish to take an early look at these videos, they are all available here: http://bit.ly/tdd-vids\nHaving made this case, we’ll conclude with the positive impact this workflow will have on a team’s ability to ship new products and new features at a sustained pace, with high levels of predictability.\nWhile PHP, Symfony and Doctrine are used for code examples, concepts in this talk are applicable to all PHP frameworks and environments, as well as other programming languages such as Java, PHP and C#.\n",

These might be entirely different than your childhood dreams.\nBut how do you reach these goals?\nHow do you accomplish these dreams?\nBy listening to your parents, friends, or teachers?\nBy doing it yourself?\nOr maybe you have given up and settled for a watered down version of the career and life you envisioned? People often attribute success to luck, and lack of success to incompetence. But what if I told you it's all about controlling the variables? Luck is something that you can control in a way. The more you figure out the context, the key players, the relationships, the values, and the rules of the ecosystem in which you want to succeed, the easier it is to gain from it. The more variables you control, the easier it is to find potential opportunities and to bank on them.\nMaybe you didn't get lucky, maybe you just saw it coming, and prepared yourself for it.\nIn this keynote talk, Thijs is going to share his experiences, his hopes, his dreams, and how he applies a positive mental attitude to level up in his career, and in life in general.\nThis is not a growth hacking talk, but a simple set of tips and tricks to succeed, even if it seems like the odds are stacked against you.\n",

When is it best to say nothing at all?\nThis talk will cover the various spheres of influence we experience and which roles we play. We'll discuss building trust for long term results and how we never ever say \"no\". We'll see how being mindful leaves us with more time and energy. Stop being a victim and start taking control.\n",

    "content": "Software Engineering can be extremely difficult and maddening. But it doesn’t have to be. We will explore leveraging various principles to make Software Engineering fun again. We’ll make a case for “Better Code” fueling “Faster Development”.\nToward building our case, we will explore 5 areas:\n* Bad Code vs Agility – What it means to be “Agile” and the impact of Bad Code on Agility.\n* Better Code: Enablers – Enabling Concepts for Better Code such as TDD, Clean Code and Patterns, with an eye toward adapting them to various programming paradigms such as Functional and OOP. While the rest of the presentation will focus on OOP, this section will contain links to great talks covering similar concepts in Functional Programming.\n* Empowering OOP – If OOP is to be chosen as a paradigm, we’ll explore what it means to play to the strengths of this paradigm.\n* Web Application Architectures: When building Web Applications, we’ll explore various architectures that may hinder or promote a sustainable business fueled by better code. We’ll look at leveraging a framework without coupling our business logic to it, to promote greater testability and extensibility. For example, by leveraging some simple patterns such as the Repository Pattern, we will look at not having to permanently commit ourselves to an RDBMS or a NoSQL solution, that it should be easy to change our minds later as business needs evolve, and even adopting “Polyglot Persistence” whereby parts of an application might leverage an RDBMS while others a NoSQL solution.\n* TDD: Better Fuels Faster – Leveraging preceding topics, we’ll put it all together in describing a workflow leveraging test-driven development for shipping better products ... faster, and having fun doing it.\nThe end of this talk will showcase code examples of a real-world Kata for building the service layer of a “Ride Hailing Application”. It will also link to recorded Kata videos, as well as a “clean slate” branch in my git repository to follow along. If you wish to take an early look at these videos, they are all available here: http://bit.ly/tdd-vids\nHaving made this case, we’ll conclude with the positive impact this workflow will have on a team’s ability to ship new products and new features at a sustained pace, with high levels of predictability.\nWhile PHP, Symfony and Doctrine are used for code examples, concepts in this talk are applicable to all PHP frameworks and environments, as well as other programming languages such as Java, PHP and C#.\n",

Deployments should not be limited to a certain time or to a certain number, otherwise they become a bottleneck for the development process.\nTo avoid disruptions when frequently deploying new versions, developers must adopt a set of practices that allow changing the database schema in production without users even noticing. As a result, the development process becomes much more safe and smooth.\nI will also talk about zero downtime deployments.

The more variables you control, the easier it is to find potential opportunities and to bank on them.\nMaybe you didn't get lucky, maybe you just saw it coming, and prepared yourself for it.\nIn this keynote talk, Thijs is going to share his experiences, his hopes, his dreams, and how he applies a positive mental attitude to level up in his career, and in life in general.\nThis is not a growth hacking talk, but a simple set of tips and tricks to succeed, even if it seems like the odds are stacked against you.\n",

    "content": "What if I told you that you don’t need 100% code coverage? Latest advancements in the PHP language and modern coding practices allow static analyzers to find a lot of bugs in our code. You won’t stop writing unit tests, but you will focus your efforts where they count the most, like business logic.\nCompiled languages need to know about the type of every variable, return type of every method etc. before the program runs. This is why the compiler needs to make sure that the program is “correct” and will happily point out to you these kinds of mistakes in the source code, like calling an undefined method or passing a wrong number of arguments to a function. The compiler acts as a first line of defense before you are able to deploy the application into production.\nOn the other hand, PHP is nothing like that. If you make a mistake, the program will crash when the line of code with the mistake is executed. When testing a PHP application, whether manually or automatically, developers spend a lot of their time discovering mistakes that wouldn’t even compile in other languages, leaving less time for testing actual business logic.\nThere are several static analyzers available for PHP that substitute the role of the compiler from other languages. By finding bugs without even having to execute the code, they can save a lot of effort that’d be spent on tedious writing of boring unit tests. In this talk, I will share tips and tricks on how to structure your code to maximize benefits from using a static analyzer. You won’t stop writing unit tests, but you will focus your efforts on areas where they count the most.\n",

One day, your marketing department makes an amazing deal and your website is swarmed by thousands and thousands of customers! That's awesome! Except your DB is sweating so hard that in 2 minutes it releases the last breath and your caches expire. Now what?! \nI've seen quite a few of these and similar situations in my career, we all hoped that caches will save us and our master  master cluster will be all fine. Until our cache server died, followed by our super cluster overloaded in a jiffy. I heard stories of other developers having similar experiences, saw websites and software going down as soon as there's way more usage than anticipated.\nI had this crazy idea, deep in my mind, which no sane person believed in - perhaps we don't really need to query all those relations all the time? Perhaps there is a different way of modelling data for high load? If caching is so hard, are we doing it correctly? I'd like to share this idea with you, with some practical examples from production and theoretical guesses. My goal is to seed new ideas into your minds, feed them with different approach which you might implement in the future. I'll be talking about data projections, events, queues, data modelling and de-normalisation. Might mention a buzzword or two like NoSQL, AWS or DDD.\n",

Splitting up into groups of three, we will build a Delivery Booking System from a list of amorphous requirements. In the first part of the workshop, we will gradually flesh out examples of how the system works using a technique known as Example Mapping. From these we’ll collaboratively write executable specifications (scenarios) in Gherkin. Writing scenarios and developing a “ubiquitous” language can be the most time consuming part of the process albeit the one in which most of the hard work is done. The second part of the workshop will focus on driving the actual application code from the scenarios and automating them. We will use some parts of the Symfony framework for the app itself and a PHP tool called Behat for executing the scenarios. This part of the workshop will also introduce some aspects of strategic domain modelling. Most of the application will be automated at the “domain level”, and given enough time, we will also automate at the UI and/or browser level.\nThe requirements for the workshop are as follows: \n- a laptop with php7 installed and php composer\nYou can start if you like, by cloning the workshop repository like this:\"git clone https://github.com/jon-acker/dpc-workshop.git\"\n",

But today we need to make sure that all the newer acronyms are being used correctly, in order to get our message across, but also to prevent others from hijacking our email system and sending out email on our behalf.\nIn this talk I will explain the inner workings of SPF (RFC7208), DKIM (RFC6376), and DMARC (RFC7489). Not only how they work together to prevent unwanted email abuse, but also how they can help make sure that your valid email reaches it’s intended audience.\nFrom this talk you will take away a deeper understanding of how modern email systems determine if the message you are sending is indeed a valid email and if it should in fact be delivered to its recipient.

    "content": "Artificial intelligence products are all the rage these days. AI is not scary, and there are a lot of awesome things you can do with it right from PHP. How do we, as LAMP stack professionals, ensure we embark this wonderful journey? I’ll show you how we built, with PHP, a devops chatbot that enables the release manager skip the confusing discussions with the tekkies and master the release process. It’s not just a simple bot, because we added from day 1 natural language processing smartness to it, so that our user base is extended to the project managers, business analysts, and customer engagement teammates. Johnny started as a devops friend for one of our customers, being extremely helpful in our day-to-day tasks. It later evolved to a tech lead/scrum master role, and even reminds us to do our timesheets. Here are some discussions you might have with Johnny: “What tickets are ready for QA?” “What version of the API is installed in production?” “Are there unused branches for the website?” \"Has test coverage decrease in the last week for the API?\" \"What is the development team on the ETL project?\" \"Add Mary as a developer to the API project\".\n",

    "content": "Software Engineering can be extremely difficult and maddening. But it doesn’t have to be. We will explore leveraging various principles to make Software Engineering fun again. We’ll make a case for “Better Code” fueling “Faster Development”.\nToward building our case, we will explore 5 areas:\n* Bad Code vs Agility – What it means to be “Agile” and the impact of Bad Code on Agility.\n* Better Code: Enablers – Enabling Concepts for Better Code such as TDD, Clean Code and Patterns, with an eye toward adapting them to various programming paradigms such as Functional and OOP. While the rest of the presentation will focus on OOP, this section will contain links to great talks covering similar concepts in Functional Programming.\n* Empowering OOP – If OOP is to be chosen as a paradigm, we’ll explore what it means to play to the strengths of this paradigm.\n* Web Application Architectures: When building Web Applications, we’ll explore various architectures that may hinder or promote a sustainable business fueled by better code. We’ll look at leveraging a framework without coupling our business logic to it, to promote greater testability and extensibility. For example, by leveraging some simple patterns such as the Repository Pattern, we will look at not having to permanently commit ourselves to an RDBMS or a NoSQL solution, that it should be easy to change our minds later as business needs evolve, and even adopting “Polyglot Persistence” whereby parts of an application might leverage an RDBMS while others a NoSQL solution.\n* TDD: Better Fuels Faster – Leveraging preceding topics, we’ll put it all together in describing a workflow leveraging test-driven development for shipping better products ... faster, and having fun doing it.\nThe end of this talk will showcase code examples of a real-world Kata for building the service layer of a “Ride Hailing Application”. It will also link to recorded Kata videos, as well as a “clean slate” branch in my git repository to follow along. If you wish to take an early look at these videos, they are all available here: http://bit.ly/tdd-vids\nHaving made this case, we’ll conclude with the positive impact this workflow will have on a team’s ability to ship new products and new features at a sustained pace, with high levels of predictability.\nWhile PHP, Symfony and Doctrine are used for code examples, concepts in this talk are applicable to all PHP frameworks and environments, as well as other programming languages such as Java, PHP and C#.\n",

Wouldn't it be great to be really efficient at it?\nUnderstanding our spheres of influence is key. When, where and how can we make the most impact and get the best results? What do we need from others, and what do they need from us? How can we be of service, without placating or just giving in? When is it best to say nothing at all?\nThis talk will cover the various spheres of influence we experience and which roles we play. We'll discuss building trust for long term results and how we never ever say \"no\". We'll see how being mindful leaves us with more time and energy. Stop being a victim and start taking control.\n",

Misunderstandings can be costly. Delivering the wrong thing following months of development can be devastating. \nHow do we make sure we are building precisely what the business requires? How can we avoid wasting time building more than is needed (a.k.a gold plating). And finally, How can working from real examples of how a system should work can drive code that fulfils the real needs of the client. We need a more \"business-aware\" form of coding.\nFollowing BDD principles, starting from high-level scenarios, that broadly drive the application, down to specifications that drive the code, I will show how we can write software guided by examples; Examples which are derived from the very requirements of the business.\n",

Except your DB is sweating so hard that in 2 minutes it releases the last breath and your caches expire. Now what?! \nI've seen quite a few of these and similar situations in my career, we all hoped that caches will save us and our master  master cluster will be all fine. Until our cache server died, followed by our super cluster overloaded in a jiffy. I heard stories of other developers having similar experiences, saw websites and software going down as soon as there's way more usage than anticipated.\nI had this crazy idea, deep in my mind, which no sane person believed in - perhaps we don't really need to query all those relations all the time? Perhaps there is a different way of modelling data for high load? If caching is so hard, are we doing it correctly? I'd like to share this idea with you, with some practical examples from production and theoretical guesses. My goal is to seed new ideas into your minds, feed them with different approach which you might implement in the future. I'll be talking about data projections, events, queues, data modelling and de-normalisation. Might mention a buzzword or two like NoSQL, AWS or DDD.\n",

Applying CQRS can lead us to a more maintainable code, code that follows the SOLID principles more closely.\nAt the heart of CQRS lies the Service Bus - a transport mechanism responsible for dispatching our command, event, and query messages to their destinations.\nThis talk will give an overview of the CQRS pattern and take a closer look at the different types of service buses - command, event, and query ones. Main takeaway will be practical information on why, when, and how to use them, with emphasis on their differences. We'll also take a look at some of the PHP libraries out there that help us work with service buses like Prooph Service Bus, Simple Bus, Tactician, to name a few.\n",

But today we need to make sure that all the newer acronyms are being used correctly, in order to get our message across, but also to prevent others from hijacking our email system and sending out email on our behalf.\nIn this talk I will explain the inner workings of SPF (RFC7208), DKIM (RFC6376), and DMARC (RFC7489). Not only how they work together to prevent unwanted email abuse, but also how they can help make sure that your valid email reaches it’s intended audience.\nFrom this talk you will take away a deeper understanding of how modern email systems determine if the message you are sending is indeed a valid email and if it should in fact be delivered to its recipient.

People often attribute success to luck, and lack of success to incompetence. But what if I told you it's all about controlling the variables? Luck is something that you can control in a way. The more you figure out the context, the key players, the relationships, the values, and the rules of the ecosystem in which you want to succeed, the easier it is to gain from it.

Except your DB is sweating so hard that in 2 minutes it releases the last breath and your caches expire. Now what?! \nI've seen quite a few of these and similar situations in my career, we all hoped that caches will save us and our master  master cluster will be all fine. Until our cache server died, followed by our super cluster overloaded in a jiffy. I heard stories of other developers having similar experiences, saw websites and software going down as soon as there's way more usage than anticipated.\nI had this crazy idea, deep in my mind, which no sane person believed in - perhaps we don't really need to query all those relations all the time? Perhaps there is a different way of modelling data for high load? If caching is so hard, are we doing it correctly? I'd like to share this idea with you, with some practical examples from production and theoretical guesses. My goal is to seed new ideas into your minds, feed them with different approach which you might implement in the future. I'll be talking about data projections, events, queues, data modelling and de-normalisation. Might mention a buzzword or two like NoSQL, AWS or DDD.\n",

Splitting up into groups of three, we will build a Delivery Booking System from a list of amorphous requirements. In the first part of the workshop, we will gradually flesh out examples of how the system works using a technique known as Example Mapping. From these we’ll collaboratively write executable specifications (scenarios) in Gherkin. Writing scenarios and developing a “ubiquitous” language can be the most time consuming part of the process albeit the one in which most of the hard work is done. The second part of the workshop will focus on driving the actual application code from the scenarios and automating them. We will use some parts of the Symfony framework for the app itself and a PHP tool called Behat for executing the scenarios. This part of the workshop will also introduce some aspects of strategic domain modelling. Most of the application will be automated at the “domain level”, and given enough time, we will also automate at the UI and/or browser level.\nThe requirements for the workshop are as follows: \n- a laptop with php7 installed and php composer\nYou can start if you like, by cloning the workshop repository like this:\"git clone https://github.com/jon-acker/dpc-workshop.git\"\n",

In a relatively short period you’ll get acquainted with the basics of asynchronous integration, CQRS, event sourcing and integrating bounded contexts.\nBefore the workshop starts, make sure you have set up the building-autonomous-services project \nFollow the instructions in the README.md file. After that, open the dashboard page and click around to verify that everything works.\n",

Splitting up into groups of three, we will build a Delivery Booking System from a list of amorphous requirements. In the first part of the workshop, we will gradually flesh out examples of how the system works using a technique known as Example Mapping. From these we’ll collaboratively write executable specifications (scenarios) in Gherkin. Writing scenarios and developing a “ubiquitous” language can be the most time consuming part of the process albeit the one in which most of the hard work is done. The second part of the workshop will focus on driving the actual application code from the scenarios and automating them. We will use some parts of the Symfony framework for the app itself and a PHP tool called Behat for executing the scenarios. This part of the workshop will also introduce some aspects of strategic domain modelling. Most of the application will be automated at the “domain level”, and given enough time, we will also automate at the UI and/or browser level.\nThe requirements for the workshop are as follows: \n- a laptop with php7 installed and php composer\nYou can start if you like, by cloning the workshop repository like this:\"git clone https://github.com/jon-acker/dpc-workshop.git\"\n",

But today we need to make sure that all the newer acronyms are being used correctly, in order to get our message across, but also to prevent others from hijacking our email system and sending out email on our behalf.\nIn this talk I will explain the inner workings of SPF (RFC7208), DKIM (RFC6376), and DMARC (RFC7489). Not only how they work together to prevent unwanted email abuse, but also how they can help make sure that your valid email reaches it’s intended audience.\nFrom this talk you will take away a deeper understanding of how modern email systems determine if the message you are sending is indeed a valid email and if it should in fact be delivered to its recipient.

    "title": "Testing Strategy with the Help of a Static Analyzer",
    "content": "What if I told you that you don’t need 100% code coverage? Latest advancements in the PHP language and modern coding practices allow static analyzers to find a lot of bugs in our code. You won’t stop writing unit tests, but you will focus your efforts where they count the most, like business logic.\nCompiled languages need to know about the type of every variable, return type of every method etc. before the program runs. This is why the compiler needs to make sure that the program is “correct” and will happily point out to you these kinds of mistakes in the source code, like calling an undefined method or passing a wrong number of arguments to a function. The compiler acts as a first line of defense before you are able to deploy the application into production.\nOn the other hand, PHP is nothing like that. If you make a mistake, the program will crash when the line of code with the mistake is executed. When testing a PHP application, whether manually or automatically, developers spend a lot of their time discovering mistakes that wouldn’t even compile in other languages, leaving less time for testing actual business logic.\nThere are several static analyzers available for PHP that substitute the role of the compiler from other languages. By finding bugs without even having to execute the code, they can save a lot of effort that’d be spent on tedious writing of boring unit tests. In this talk, I will share tips and tricks on how to structure your code to maximize benefits from using a static analyzer. You won’t stop writing unit tests, but you will focus your efforts on areas where they count the most.\n",

Deployments should not be limited to a certain time or to a certain number, otherwise they become a bottleneck for the development process.\nTo avoid disruptions when frequently deploying new versions, developers must adopt a set of practices that allow changing the database schema in production without users even noticing.

That’s all marketing fluff.\nContainers are simply a shorthand name for leveraging newer features of operating system kernels that let the OS lie to programs about how they’re running. In fact, all of modern software is built on lies.  That’s what’s useful about it!\nTo understand how that works, why it’s so useful, and where it’s not, let’s dive into how software actually works on a modern Linux system to see how those kernel features fit into the big picture, building up to “containers” along the way.

The new changes focus on enabling easier cloud deployments & less manual configuration, while supporting both lean microservice setups as well as monolithic applications. During this workshop, we will create microservice-style apps using Flex to get a feel for how the new bootstrapping mechanism works touching all major new features: - Project setup - Use of the recipes and contrib recipes repositories - Bundle-less application architecture - Dependency Injection improvements since 3.3 To get the most out of this workshop you should already be familiar with Symfony 2 or 3.\nThe requirements for the workshop are as follows:\n- PHP 7.1.3 or higher\n- a recent version of Composer (preferably around v1.6) installed\n- a database like SQLite, MySQL or Postgres, corresponding driver support in PHP and credentials to connect to the database in your PHP application\n- Your favourite IDE or code editor such as PhpStorm, Sublime Text or something similar\nYou can check your installed PHP version using the command `php --version` on your Terminal/Command Line/Power Shell. The free ebook PHP The Right Way provides help on different ways of installing newer PHP versions on Mac or Windows.\nIf you do not have a database server running on your computer or are not sure how to connect to it, I recommend installing sqlite3 and the PHP extensions php-sqlite and pdo-sqlite. When you have an existing PHP application that uses Doctrine or PDO to connect to a database you should be fine.\nWe will make heavy use of composer and the Flex composer-plugin. This will require at least v1.0.2 of composer. Some GNU/Linux distros ship with an older version (~1.0). Please make sure you either upgrade that version or install an alternative.\n",

The idea behind CQRS is to split our models in two - the Command for writing, and the Query for reading. Applying CQRS can lead us to a more maintainable code, code that follows the SOLID principles more closely.\nAt the heart of CQRS lies the Service Bus - a transport mechanism responsible for dispatching our command, event, and query messages to their destinations.\nThis talk will give an overview of the CQRS pattern and take a closer look at the different types of service buses - command, event, and query ones. Main takeaway will be practical information on why, when, and how to use them, with emphasis on their differences. We'll also take a look at some of the PHP libraries out there that help us work with service buses like Prooph Service Bus, Simple Bus, Tactician, to name a few.\n",

We’ll make a case for “Better Code” fueling “Faster Development”.\nToward building our case, we will explore 5 areas:\n* Bad Code vs Agility – What it means to be “Agile” and the impact of Bad Code on Agility.\n* Better Code: Enablers – Enabling Concepts for Better Code such as TDD, Clean Code and Patterns, with an eye toward adapting them to various programming paradigms such as Functional and OOP. While the rest of the presentation will focus on OOP, this section will contain links to great talks covering similar concepts in Functional Programming.\n* Empowering OOP – If OOP is to be chosen as a paradigm, we’ll explore what it means to play to the strengths of this paradigm.\n* Web Application Architectures: When building Web Applications, we’ll explore various architectures that may hinder or promote a sustainable business fueled by better code. We’ll look at leveraging a framework without coupling our business logic to it, to promote greater testability and extensibility. For example, by leveraging some simple patterns such as the Repository Pattern, we will look at not having to permanently commit ourselves to an RDBMS or a NoSQL solution, that it should be easy to change our minds later as business needs evolve, and even adopting “Polyglot Persistence” whereby parts of an application might leverage an RDBMS while others a NoSQL solution.\n* TDD: Better Fuels Faster – Leveraging preceding topics, we’ll put it all together in describing a workflow leveraging test-driven development for shipping better products ... faster, and having fun doing it.\nThe end of this talk will showcase code examples of a real-world Kata for building the service layer of a “Ride Hailing Application”. It will also link to recorded Kata videos, as well as a “clean slate” branch in my git repository to follow along. If you wish to take an early look at these videos, they are all available here: http://bit.ly/tdd-vids\nHaving made this case, we’ll conclude with the positive impact this workflow will have on a team’s ability to ship new products and new features at a sustained pace, with high levels of predictability.\nWhile PHP, Symfony and Doctrine are used for code examples, concepts in this talk are applicable to all PHP frameworks and environments, as well as other programming languages such as Java, PHP and C#.\n",

    "content": "Almost everyone uses docker, but without really knowing what it is or does under the hood.\nTo be fair, it just works and the whole thing with namespaces and images is a dry topic.\nThis talk will show you how Docker works, the fun way!\nThe most important thing to know is, docker is just a product name for a program that uses several already long-existing technologies to create its containers.\nWell, it's a little bit more, since it provides the docker hub infrastructure, a vital part of docker's success.\nSince understanding docker means understanding the underlying principles, you will see how to create your own container without using anything docker.\nTo do this a small program is written in golang (you don't need to know the language) that creates a real container.\nDuring this process, you will get to know and, most importantly, understand how docker works.\nWhy would you want to know how Docker works internally?\nIf you know the concept by heart, working with docker and especially debugging weird stuff it does from time to time becomes a breeze.\n​Additionally to the things above you will get deeper knowledge about images, the second most important thing apart from containers.\nThe talk is aimed at programmers who struggle to understand docker or just want to know more about a technology they use every day.\nBe aware: How to use Docker in daily business is not part of this talk.\n",

    "content": "What if I told you that you don’t need 100% code coverage? Latest advancements in the PHP language and modern coding practices allow static analyzers to find a lot of bugs in our code. You won’t stop writing unit tests, but you will focus your efforts where they count the most, like business logic.\nCompiled languages need to know about the type of every variable, return type of every method etc. before the program runs. This is why the compiler needs to make sure that the program is “correct” and will happily point out to you these kinds of mistakes in the source code, like calling an undefined method or passing a wrong number of arguments to a function. The compiler acts as a first line of defense before you are able to deploy the application into production.\nOn the other hand, PHP is nothing like that. If you make a mistake, the program will crash when the line of code with the mistake is executed. When testing a PHP application, whether manually or automatically, developers spend a lot of their time discovering mistakes that wouldn’t even compile in other languages, leaving less time for testing actual business logic.\nThere are several static analyzers available for PHP that substitute the role of the compiler from other languages. By finding bugs without even having to execute the code, they can save a lot of effort that’d be spent on tedious writing of boring unit tests. In this talk, I will share tips and tricks on how to structure your code to maximize benefits from using a static analyzer. You won’t stop writing unit tests, but you will focus your efforts on areas where they count the most.\n",

During this workshop, we will create microservice-style apps using Flex to get a feel for how the new bootstrapping mechanism works touching all major new features: - Project setup - Use of the recipes and contrib recipes repositories - Bundle-less application architecture - Dependency Injection improvements since 3.3 To get the most out of this workshop you should already be familiar with Symfony 2 or 3.\nThe requirements for the workshop are as follows:\n- PHP 7.1.3 or higher\n- a recent version of Composer (preferably around v1.6) installed\n- a database like SQLite, MySQL or Postgres, corresponding driver support in PHP and credentials to connect to the database in your PHP application\n- Your favourite IDE or code editor such as PhpStorm, Sublime Text or something similar\nYou can check your installed PHP version using the command `php --version` on your Terminal/Command Line/Power Shell. The free ebook PHP The Right Way provides help on different ways of installing newer PHP versions on Mac or Windows.\nIf you do not have a database server running on your computer or are not sure how to connect to it, I recommend installing sqlite3 and the PHP extensions php-sqlite and pdo-sqlite. When you have an existing PHP application that uses Doctrine or PDO to connect to a database you should be fine.\nWe will make heavy use of composer and the Flex composer-plugin.

That’s what’s useful about it!\nTo understand how that works, why it’s so useful, and where it’s not, let’s dive into how software actually works on a modern Linux system to see how those kernel features fit into the big picture, building up to “containers” along the way.  Pull back the veil of lies and see how your computer really works\n",

Deployments should not be limited to a certain time or to a certain number, otherwise they become a bottleneck for the development process.\nTo avoid disruptions when frequently deploying new versions, developers must adopt a set of practices that allow changing the database schema in production without users even noticing.

    "title": "Testing Strategy with the Help of a Static Analyzer",
    "content": "What if I told you that you don’t need 100% code coverage? Latest advancements in the PHP language and modern coding practices allow static analyzers to find a lot of bugs in our code. You won’t stop writing unit tests, but you will focus your efforts where they count the most, like business logic.\nCompiled languages need to know about the type of every variable, return type of every method etc. before the program runs. This is why the compiler needs to make sure that the program is “correct” and will happily point out to you these kinds of mistakes in the source code, like calling an undefined method or passing a wrong number of arguments to a function. The compiler acts as a first line of defense before you are able to deploy the application into production.\nOn the other hand, PHP is nothing like that. If you make a mistake, the program will crash when the line of code with the mistake is executed. When testing a PHP application, whether manually or automatically, developers spend a lot of their time discovering mistakes that wouldn’t even compile in other languages, leaving less time for testing actual business logic.\nThere are several static analyzers available for PHP that substitute the role of the compiler from other languages. By finding bugs without even having to execute the code, they can save a lot of effort that’d be spent on tedious writing of boring unit tests. In this talk, I will share tips and tricks on how to structure your code to maximize benefits from using a static analyzer. You won’t stop writing unit tests, but you will focus your efforts on areas where they count the most.\n",

We'll figure out some ways in which we can invert dependencies and leverage a messaging solution to achieve autonomy after all. In a relatively short period you’ll get acquainted with the basics of asynchronous integration, CQRS, event sourcing and integrating bounded contexts.\nBefore the workshop starts, make sure you have set up the building-autonomous-services project \nFollow the instructions in the README.md file.

But today we need to make sure that all the newer acronyms are being used correctly, in order to get our message across, but also to prevent others from hijacking our email system and sending out email on our behalf.\nIn this talk I will explain the inner workings of SPF (RFC7208), DKIM (RFC6376), and DMARC (RFC7489). Not only how they work together to prevent unwanted email abuse, but also how they can help make sure that your valid email reaches it’s intended audience.\nFrom this talk you will take away a deeper understanding of how modern email systems determine if the message you are sending is indeed a valid email and if it should in fact be delivered to its recipient. You will learn how these services need to be configured and how to debug the email delivery process when an email does not reach it’s intended destination when any of them aren’t correctly configured.\n",

Except your DB is sweating so hard that in 2 minutes it releases the last breath and your caches expire. Now what?! \nI've seen quite a few of these and similar situations in my career, we all hoped that caches will save us and our master  master cluster will be all fine. Until our cache server died, followed by our super cluster overloaded in a jiffy. I heard stories of other developers having similar experiences, saw websites and software going down as soon as there's way more usage than anticipated.\nI had this crazy idea, deep in my mind, which no sane person believed in - perhaps we don't really need to query all those relations all the time? Perhaps there is a different way of modelling data for high load? If caching is so hard, are we doing it correctly? I'd like to share this idea with you, with some practical examples from production and theoretical guesses. My goal is to seed new ideas into your minds, feed them with different approach which you might implement in the future.

Main takeaway will be practical information on why, when, and how to use them, with emphasis on their differences.
